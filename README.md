# Retrieve

_Retrieve_ is an image research index engine. 

The web based architecture is developed in **ReactJS** and **Python** with interactive interface for similarity search.

The VGG19 and VGG16 models have been used as embeddings extractors for the images (finetuned and not). Then **PPIndex** has been used as index engine for the research.

I've also made a statistical analysis of the performance of the research engine and the limitations of the index.
